      "### One-Bowl Chocolate Cake Recipe\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Ingredients:\n",
      "- 2 cups white sugar\n",
      "- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour\n",
      "- ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder\n",
      "- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder\n",
      "- 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon salt\n",
      "- 2 large eggs\n",
      "- 1 cup milk\n",
      "- ½ cup vegetable oil\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n",
      "- 1 cup boiling water\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Preheat the Oven:**\n",
      "   Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Gather Ingredients:**\n",
      "   Measure out all your ingredients and set them aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Mix Dry Ingredients:**\n",
      "   In a large mixing bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix them together until well combined.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add Wet Ingredients:**\n",
      "   Add the eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Mix until everything is well combined.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Add Boiling Water:**\n",
      "   Carefully stir in the boiling water. The batter will be thin, but that's okay! This helps create a moist cake.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Prepare the Pan:**\n",
      "   Grease and flour your cake pans (two 9-inch round pans or a 9x13 inch pan).\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Pour the Batter:**\n",
      "   Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans (if using round pans) or pour it all into the 9x13 pan.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Bake:**\n",
      "   Bake in the preheated oven for about 30-35 minutes (for round pans) or 35-40 minutes (for a 9x13 pan). Check for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center – it should come out clean.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Cool:**\n",
      "   Once baked, remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Frost (Optional):**\n",
      "   Once the cake is completely cool, you can frost it with your favorite chocolate frosting.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Tips:\n",
      "- Make sure all your ingredients are at room temperature for the best results.\n",
      "- Don't open the oven door during baking as it can cause the cake to collapse.\n",
      "- If you're unsure about the cakes being done, it's better to check a few minutes early.\n",
      "\n",

      "Final answer: To bake a cake, follow these step-by-step instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Preheat the Oven**: Start by preheating your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Prepare the Baking Pan**: Grease and flour a 9 x 13 inch baking pan to prevent the cake from sticking.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Gather Ingredients**: In a large bowl, mix together the following:\n",
      "   - Eggs\n",
      "   - Sugar\n",
      "   - Vanilla extract\n",
      "   - Salt\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a separate bowl, combine your dry ingredients, which typically include flour, baking powder, and any other dry flavorings you wish to add.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Combine Mixtures**: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing until everything is well combined and smooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Pour and Bake**: Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth the top. Place it in the preheated oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Cool**: Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for a few minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Frost and Serve**: After the cake has cooled, you can frost it with your favorite icing or serve it plain.\n",
