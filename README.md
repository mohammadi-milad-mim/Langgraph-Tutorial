# Langgraph Tutorial

Welcome to the **Langgraph Tutorial**, a comprehensive repository designed to teach and demonstrate key concepts and tools for building cutting-edge NLP systems. This repository accompanies the workshop series at the **University of Tehran** and serves as a practical resource for exploring Langgraph, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), tool usage with LLMs, and chatbot development.

## Repository Structure
The repository is divided into five parts, each focusing on a specific topic with hands-on examples and clear explanations.

### **Part 1 - Langgraph Basics**
Learn the fundamentals of Langgraph, including:
- **Graph Components**: Nodes, edges, and their construction.
- **LangChain Components**: 
  - ChatModel
  - Messages
  - Structured Output
  - Tavily Search API integration
- **Example**: Build a simple search bot with query rewriting.

### **Part 2 - RAG Using LlamaParse and LanceDB**
Master the process of creating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline:
- Document processing and chunking
- Embedding and storing data
- Retrieval and integration into RAG workflows
- Practical demonstration of LlamaParse and LanceDB in action

### **Part 3 - Tool Use**
Explore the concept of tool usage with LLMs:
- Definition and applications of tool use
- Example: Implement a search function as a tool for LLMs

### **Part 4 - ReAct Agent with Memory**
Build intelligent agents with reasoning and action capabilities:
- Create a simple ReAct agent
- Add memory functionality to enhance interactions

### **Part 5 - Chainlit as Chatbot UI**
Integrate your Langgraph system with Chainlit for a user-friendly interface:
- Connect graphs to Chainlit
- Use session memory for enhanced chatbot functionality

## Getting Started
